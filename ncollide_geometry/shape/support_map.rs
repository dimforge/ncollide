///   * V - type of the support mapping direction argument and of the returned point.

     * Evaluates the support function of the object. A support function is a
     * function associating a vector to the shape point which maximizes their
     * dot product. This does not include the `margin` of the object. Margins are
     * shape-dependent. Use `support_point` to sample the complete shape.
     *
     * # Arguments:
     *  * `dir` - the input of the support function. It is not required for it to
     *            be normalized.
