/// Groups of collision used to filter which object interact with which other one.
///
/// There are at most 30 groups indexed from 0 to 29 (included). This identifies collidable
/// entities by combining three attributes:
///    * A set of group this structure is member of.
///    * A collision group whitelist.
///    * A collision group blacklist.
///
/// For two entities to interact, they must be member of at least one group part of each-other's
/// whitelists, and must not be part of any blacklisted group. The blacklist always has priority on
/// the whitelist.
///
/// ### Example
/// For example if the object A is such that:
///    * It is part of the groups 1, 3, and 6.
///    * It whitelists the groups 6 and 7.
///    * It blacklists the group 1.
/// Let the object B be such that:
///    * It is part of the groups 1, 3, and 7.
///    * It whitelists the groups 3 and 7.
///    * It does not blacklist anything.
/// For example if the object C is such that:
///    * It is part of the groups 6 and 9.
///    * It whitelists the groups 3 and 7.
///    * It does not blacklist anything.
///
/// Then we have:
///    * A and C can interact because A whitelists the group 6 (which C is part of), and,
///    reciprocally, C whitelists the group 3 (which A is part of).
///    * A and B will **not** interact because B is part of the group 1 which is blacklisted by A.
///    * Finally, B and C will **not** interact either because, even if C whitelists the group 3
///    (which B is part of), B does not whitelists the groups 6 nor 9 (which B is part of).
